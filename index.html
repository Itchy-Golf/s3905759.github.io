								<h2 class="major">My Motivations</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/turing.jpg" alt="Alan Turning's First Computer" /></span>
								<p>My personal interest in IT comes partly from the people I admire. This includes both personal connections such as friends and family in the industry who have excelled but also to high profile figures such as Elon Musk and Lex Fridman of MIT. During school I couldn’t picture myself working within IT, however as I have matured, IT and its various forms have drawn my interest and have presented themselves as an academic challenge which excites me. Due to this, I do not have a depth of IT experience. I have built multiple computers so I have a good understanding of the hardware involved and each components purpose. However I am looking forward to now learning how the computer thinks.
<br>
<br>
During the selection process of degrees, it was a choice between either psychology or IT, both of which I saw as an academic challenge that gives you as much back as you invest. After deciding on IT, due to its career opportunities I read that RMIT has a strong history of success in IT when compared to other universities. Working full time while studying also made RMIT an ideal choice for me due to the online study method offered.
<br>
<br>
Throughout my studies I look to further my knowledge of hardware and to also become well versed in multiple programming languages. I am expecting to learn about the landscape of the current job market within IT and where its future will be so I can apply my studies towards that direction. It will also be of value to learn more of the history from where IT has come, from Bletchley Park to today.</p>

								<h2 class="major">The Ideal Role</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/coding.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My ideal job will include my two strengths wrapped into one role. For me these strengths would be leadership and IT experience. This is why an IT project manager role appeals to me, the combination of leading and mentoring a team of ambitious professionals while also working within IT is an ideal situation for me.
									<br>
<br>
The role centers around organizing the implementation of technologies that help assist remote working as becoming more of a normal mode of work within the company, with the hope of reframing the traditional office environment into a collaboration and team building space. As a management role, I will be required to ensure that during this transition we utilize the appropriate technological tools to assist and to ensure that the teams I lead are still operating efficiently during the transitionary period. This role will require strong leadership and communication skills, both of which appeal to me as a great balance/utilization of my skills.
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/JD.jpg" alt="A typical job Description" style="float:right;width:300px;height:450px;">
This role is a senior roles within project management and as such the skills required are quite high. A diverse background in project management with long history is required along with a proven track record for success in these previous roles. A tertiary degree will be required in either business or technology with knowledge of financial services. Experience in leadership/coaching is required also, to train and manage teams.
<br>
<br>
In my current role I currently possess strong leadership skills, with three colleagues below me who report to me as their up line. Coaching and mentoring them is a key part of my day to day role. I am also studying this degree to fulfil the tertiary requirement.
<br>
<br>
In order to gain my experience needed for this role, I will need to ensure that I continue to be in management roles as I progress up to a project manager role. Completing my degree and possibly moving into a masters shortly after can help give me the advantage over others applying for these level positions. Transitioning from health and fitness, my current industry, and into the cybersecurity space for banking institutions can help me move laterally into one of these roles and some internal career progression.

								<h2 class="major">Personality Tests</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/protagonist_header.svg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Myer Briggs Results</h3>
								<p style="text-align:justify;">My personal result for the Myer Briggs test was ENFJ or <em>“The Protagonist”</em>. Protagonists are leaders by nature, characterized often by their charisma and energy. People with the ENFJ personality type account for around 2% of the world’s population and are often those who work in positions of power out a longing to do good in the world. With their natural confidence and talent for influence, they find purpose in helping others around them while improving on themselves too. They are strong believers in the people and are unafraid to stand up for what they feel in right. Protagonists are authentic people who do their best to walk the walk and talk the talk, with some of their most valued moments leading others with contagious passion.</p>
<img src="images/protagonist.png" alt="A noble knight as a symbol of leadership qualities" style="float:right;width:"300px;height:300px";">
<h4>Strengths</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Natural Leaders</li>
	<li>Tolerant</li>
	<li>Realiable</li>
	<li>Charismatic</li>
</ul>
<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Natural Leaders</li>
	<li>Overly Idealistic</li>
	<li>Unstable Self-Esteem</li>
	<li>Highly Sensitive</li>
</ul>
<h4>Workplace Habits</h4>
<ul>
	<li>As Subordinates – Protagonists are quick learners and are usually fast to make a positive impression on their boss. They are great multiple taskers and achieve results with high levels of competence. Hardworking, reliable and happy to help are all words that can be used to these people up however at time this can be taken advantage of by managers who will overload them with work recognizing their ability to do well with the work given to them.</li>
	<li>As Colleagues – A protagonist colleague will always strive to assist and include their coworkers in teams where self-expression is welcome and comfortable. They find being sociable and friendly easy with the ability to work closely with others to create win win situations within the work environment. This willingness to help can sometimes be taken advantage of by others as the protagonist is too sensitive to how others feel. This can leave them with piles of others duties on their plate.</li>
	<li>As Managers – The role where the true ability of protagonists is revealed is in managerial positions. In these positions their motivating communication and sensitivity for others comes to work in a powerful tandem. In these positions they can utilize their natural charisma and likeability to push their team forward together towards their goals. As long as the end goal is reached and everyone in their team is content in their roles, the protagonist is satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Language</h4>
<p>For my learning language test I received the following results</p>
<ul>
	<li>Auditory: 30%</li>
	<li>Visual: 40%</li>
	<li>Tactile: 30%</li>
</ul>
<h4>Big 5 Factors</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Extraversion - 90</li>
	<li>Neuroticism - 34</li>
	<li>Agreeableness - 83</li>
	<li>Conscientiousness - 62</li>
	<li>Intellect - 46</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>The results of these tests and their predictions of my demeanor are far extending into my professional career. The Myer Brigg’s personality test revealed that I am an ENJF, or as put by their website, a ‘protagonist’. A leadership position seemingly becomes the apparent best option for myself as a career goal. Along with this process, it’s important to keep in mind the strengths/weaknesses that accompany this personality type. This position could be complimented by the two other test results by highlighting other important factors for leadership. For example, my high extraversion score in the Big 5 Test, along with the accompanying strong emotional stability and agreeableness set a strong foundation for leadership qualities. It also has helped to determine what work environment I could succeed in as a leader, which being a louder more convivial work environment. The test relating to my learning style is more applicable for intrapersonal reflection regarding how I best take in information. This comes into a strong play when self-work is being implemented by initiative to make myself a better leader.</p>

<p>These results would clearly greatly dictate my actions within a team. The greatest of these determinations coming from the ENFJ Myer Brigg’s results. Via the results granted upon the completion of this test it can be seen that I will work best within a leadership position, this is not to say that there would be no value to the appointment of myself as a colleague. It is apparent that my strengths within a team lie in relation to being understanding of other’s needs and having the charisma to inspire others towards our unified goal. Some weaknesses that could lead to negative results would be the result of too much idealism and over sensitivity, both in self-talk and the feedback of peers. If within a team setting I did not strive to address these possible weak points while simultaneously highlighting my strengths, I would be of cautious use in either a leadership or subordinate role. According to the results presented above my behavior within a team then could be either very positive, with my charisma and likeability having the energy to inspire a team, or on the opposite spectrum my behavior could become emotionally variable and unpredictable if over sensitivity presents itself, eliminating my charisma and causing morale of the team to be brought down.
Taking these results into account when forming a team, as prior mentioned, I would need to ensure that I keep a self-observant eye on my behavior to ensure that my strengths are being present. Along with this, finding a team where my strength of leadership could be best utilized would be ideal, with other team members making up for my weaknesses. My organizational skills for example, as shown in my Big 5 Factor results, are weak. Finding a team member who doesn’t have leadership or extraversion as strengths but does have strong organizational skills could result in a complimenting partnership, as we make up for each other’s weaknesses. Finding team members who complement each other’s weaknesses while also having compatible personalities will be the key to ensuring I form a team that can achieve set goal.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Project</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/rock.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><em>Form Factor</em> is an all encompassing health app that educates its modern users about the how’s and why’s of healthy nutrition and training. It’s a comprehensive application that provides overall food education such as calorie counts and macronutrient advice. Its value is then compounded by the addition of features like workout guides, supplement assistance and most importantly, custom generated food plans. These food plans will be presented after completion of the initial steps;</p>
<ol>
	<li>Discovering macronutrients and calorie expenditure</li>
	<li>Understanding Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) and correct body composition for certain goals</li>
	<li>Selecting your ideal body composition</li>
	<li>Eliminating products the user does not wish to consume or dietary requirements</li>
</ol>
<p>These prior steps will all be factored into recommending the user a calorie count and subsequent food plan to help them achieve their goals. They will also be provided training plan recommendations according to their body composition choice. Form Factor is in the fitness app category, however with its focus and necessity of nutritional and fitness learning, it distances itself from its possible counterparts that contain just a fraction of one of Form Factors features.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Although the market for an app like Form Factor is somewhat saturated, the app itself will be a market first. It is differentiated by its educational value, combating common diet myths such as; “You can lose 10kg in 1 Month” and “Fad diets will help you lose weight” (<em>Mukherjee and Mishra, 2015</em>). Similar apps in the market such as Under Armour’s My Fitness Pal and My Diet Coach only dealt with its user on a superficial level; providing little personalised feedback and often they failed to assess the user’s prior knowledge of nutrition, if any (<em>Davis et al., 2016</em>). This has caused a dislike towards fitness apps among users seeking to change their body composition (<em>Solbrig et al., 2017</em>). The results delivered to the public via clinical and commercial weight loss programs are not desirable, as they produce weight loss but around 40% of users regain that weight (<em>Tsai & Wadden, 2005</em>). Users of these apps complain about not enough automation and a lack of motivation (<em>Davis et al., 2016</em>). Along with these negative factors, the majority of fitness apps lack evidence based designs, attempting to guess what features should be included (<em>Tang, Abraham, Stamp & Greaves, 2014</em>). Form Factor would aim to disrupt this market by providing sufficient motivation, knowledge and motivation to keep their users achieving goals with an app designed around functions who have purpose.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p><em>Form Factor</em> will be unique in the industry due to its level of nutritional education provided and it’s assistance in key areas of working out that for novices, can be quite difficult. These areas include but are not limited to, diet and training regimes. The goal of our app will be to ensure education is taken on board and learnt before any working out or dieting happens. To achieve this it will take the member through the prior mentioned steps below.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Discovering macronutrients and calorie expenditure</li>
	<li>Understanding Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) and correct body composition for certain goals</li>
	<li>Selecting your ideal body composition</li>
	<li>Eliminating products the user does not wish to consume or dietary requirements</li>
</ol>
<p>Beginning the user’s journey with education regarding what food consists of (macronutrients) and how these affect your body composition journey is foundational to a successful fitness journey. Without this prior knowledge, dieting has no ‘why’ behind it or understanding as to how dieting really works. This will then be accompanied by TDEE explanations, with the user selecting their ideal body composition following this education. This will help the application learn what the user wishes to look like in the future.<p>
<p>All of these educational steps will take form as interactive diagrams and dialogues with quick quizzes at the end of each section to ensure knowledge retention. If key questions are failed in this test, the app auto recommends going back over selected areas in need of improvement.
Once the knowledge section is complete, the user can select food that’s don’t fit their dietary requirements from an array of images. This will help the app decide what food to include in their custom diet.</p>
<p>A custom diet will then be generated from a selection of foods and serving sizes to help the user achieve their outlined goal in the prior steps. The user will have the option to ‘refresh’ certain food items that they do not like. For example if the user is recommended a chicken salad for dinner however they would prefer another item, they can click the ‘refresh’ button and have a new food option cycled into their diet. They can do this action as many times as they wish to find a suitable replacement.</p>
<p>This feature not only solves the guess work that comes along with diet planning, it also means that the user will not have to continuously input their food into a calorie counting app, as is often a deterrent to consumers using these products (<em>Davis et al., 2016</em>). If the user wishes to have more variety, then a unique diet for each day can be saved for each day of the week.</p>
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>As Form Factor will be a two dimensional application, a key piece of software for its development will be Coco2D. Native app development will be key so the utilisation of cocos2d-swift and cocos2d-JS will be required for IOS and Android development respectably. As this project will be constructed by a team that is physically spread apart, the utilisation of Git will be key for development and team collaboration.</p>
<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>To achieve an app that is interactive and is partly gamified by design to maintain the user’s attention, Form Factor will require some intermediate skills in Objective C to be successful. However along with this, reasonable knowledge in Open-GI and Cocos2d will be required.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>If the project is successful then there will be frequent positive transformation stories returning to our team, letting us know how the changed their outlook on fitness. The original problems mentioned in the motivation behind this app will be solved within our community. Such as a lack of motivation or the abandonment of calorie counting apps due to them being too much work. We will be able to see an active fitness community who are learning the basics of health and fitness, taking on board their custom diet plans and changing them over time. This application will hopefully lead to further health education within the global fitness community, cutting through the clutter online of fads and myths, simplifying this exciting journey into something achievable for anyone taking it one step at a time.</p>
